# camera-trap-data-sharing

Some of my research work from within the lab of Dr. Sara Beery @ MIT CSAIL:

As large-scale machine learning systems increasingly demand unprecedented volumes of data, the act of data sharing emerges as a pivotal concern. This challenge becomes particularly pronounced in the context of machine learning systems tailored for biodiversity tasks—a critical facet of contemporary conservation efforts—where sensitive data and concerns of data sovereignty (resulting from historically extractive practices) often hinder global cooperation. This project recognizes the urgent need to holistically confront these challenges and promote effective wildlife preservation in the face of climate change and ecological degradation.	

The primary problem under investigation is the impact of geopolitical data sharing policies on machine learning-based automated camera trap data processing in ecological research. This involves understanding how data sharing practices across geopolitical boundaries affect the efficacy of machine learning algorithms in species identification and biodiversity analysis, focusing on the Labeled Information Library of Alexandria: Biology and Conservation (LILA BC) Snapshot Safari (and potentially North American Camera Trap) dataset network(s) as a case study.
